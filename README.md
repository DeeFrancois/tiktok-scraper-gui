# The Unofficial GUI for the Unofficial TikTokApi

Provides a user friendly interface for the [Unofficial TikTok Api](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api). Allows you to download your liked videos, videos from the trending page, user uploads, and more.

<sup> Latest Update: **v0.7** New Tabs for byHashtag/bySearch, Bookmarks Page, Allows importing cookies as a workaround for current api bugs </sup>

**Disclaimer: The API that this was made for is no longer functional which means this project is mostly just here for showcasing at this point. It can still work if you manually give it a list of tiktoks with a very specific format so if you're really interested in using this for some reason just contact me and I can show you how to set it up**

## Motivation
I use TikTok for language learning and stumbled upon the very useful [Unofficial TikTok Api](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api) while looking for a way to download the videos. Figured it would be more efficient to use if it had an interface. Initially, I was just focused on downloading TikTok likes, but then I kept wanting to add more and more features to create a more complete and intuitive experience. I was also interested in getting experience with collaberating on a Github project, although I don't feel this is polished enough to share yet.

## External dependencies
- ffmpeg - https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

- youtube-dl - https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl

## Python dependencies

- TikTokApi
- youtube_dl

You can just use pip to install them with the requirements.txt file provided

## Importing your cookies

The API currently has a couple of bugs when it comes to the verification process during data fetching. However, they can be circumvented by providing your own cookies. To do this you will have to log in to the TikTok website, use a browser extension to export your cookies into a JSON file, and place that file in the same folder as the program. Doing this will also allow you to fetch your likes without having to make them public. 

Your JSON file should consist of a list of cookies formatted like so:
```
    {
    "domain": ".tiktok.com",
    "expirationDate": XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX,
    "hostOnly": false,
    "httpOnly": false,
    "name": "passport_csrf_token",
    "path": "/",
    "sameSite": "no_restriction",
    "secure": true,
    "session": false,
    "storeId": "0",
    "value": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "origin": "https://www.tiktok.com"
    },
```

## Usage

**Make sure your likes are public, enter your username in the top bar, click Retrieve TikToks**

<sup> *Retrievals are cached but the links expire after a day (?) so make sure you clear the cache eventually in order to get a fresh batch. </sup>
