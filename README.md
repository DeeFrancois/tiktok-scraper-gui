# The Unofficial GUI for the Unofficial TikTokApi

<sup> Latest Update: **v0.8** New Tabs for byHashtag/bySearch, Bookmarks Page, Allows importing cookies to workaround current api bugs </sup>

Provides a user friendly interface for the [Unofficial TikTok Api](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api). Allows you to download your liked videos, videos from the trending page, user uploads, and more.

#### *Currently only works if you input your own cookies after logging into the TikTok website. Once I can automate this process, I will release it as an exe*


## Motivation
I figured more people could benefit from this api if it had an interface. I was also interested in getting experience with collaberating on a Github project, although I don't feel this is polished enough to share yet.

## How to use

**Make sure your likes are public, enter your username in the top bar, click Retrieve TikToks**

- Left Click to Download (or to Select if Automated Download Mode is enabled)
- Right Click to Preview
- Middle Click to get extra details (Extra Details tab must be enabled)
- Click on the user avatar to open in your browser
- "Show Player" will open a companion video player (powered by [mpv](https://github.com/jaseg/python-mpv)) in another window for scrolling through downloaded videos
- Once the cache expires, uncheck "Used Cached List" to retrieve a fresh list
